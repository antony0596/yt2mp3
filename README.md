# YouTube to MP3

Simple application to download audio tracks from YouTube videos.

Please note that this application is not intended to be used for illegal purposes.

If you are to download a video that is not yours, please make sure you have the rights to do so.

I am learning to program so this is intended to be a learning experience for me.

If you are looking to listen to popular music, I highly encourage you to use services like Spotify, YouTube Premium/Music, or Apple Music.

Personally I have a YouTube Premium family subscription. This way I get to listen to music without ads and I can download videos to watch offline.

By having the family subscription, I can share my account with my family and friends and share the costs. This is a great way to save money on your subscription.

## Installation

You can just download the executable from the "dist" folder.

It is a standalone executable so you don't need to install anything.

## Usage

Copy a video or playlist URL into the text box and click the download button.

## Known issues

I am aware that running the application will simply look like it's opening and will then crash.
